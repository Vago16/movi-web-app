Capstone 

The tech stack I will be using for this project is React and Node.

I believe at this moment at time front-end UI will be the focus but will like to implement steps to make it a full-stack application.

This will be a website at this point in time as I do not have the knowledge to make it into an app.

The website will let users create “wish lists” of movies they want to watch soon and offer info where to stream them online possibly.  Making friends online benefits the user as they get access to more recommended movies outside of what they know, and can compete in “watch goals” for the week to show they’re accomplishing watching movies from their wishlist.  Movies can be reviewed and commented on with keywords to help search result efficiency.

The Movi website will be for movie lovers, with a focus on older genre defining films and vintage films maybe, and lets them browse according to genre, their likes, what their friends have watched, possibly keywords, and/or by search results.

OMDB API- To get access to the API used in this project, visit https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx, and if not at the screen to apply for an API key, at the top there should be a searchbar with the option to apply.  Enter in your email address and you should be sent an API key adn all data requests should be sent to http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&


A. I possibly might need to develop some of my own assets outside the API as I do not think it has everything I need.

B. Sensitive information would be password.

C. Functionality will include but not limited to; strong data protection/encryption, fast loading time.

D. User flow will be intuitive, going left to right and up to down to follow traditional reading.

E. Features that will make the site more than a CRUD DB are the ability to interact with other users as a stretch goal.  Stretch goals include creating a keyword search to tag movies with that make them searchable by a keyword list that gets updated weekly or such with polling( ie basic mood words at first and then as the need for more specific comes up then those can get implemented too.
